This project, GradAdmit-ANN-Predictor, focuses on predicting the likelihood of admission to a graduate program using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm. By training the model on a dataset containing various parameters such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, and letter of recommendation strengths, we were able to achieve an accuracy of 80% in predicting admissions outcomes.
